      Many, many thanks to everyone in team CYF Scotland - you are the best.
      Thank you to the teachers, teaching assistants and Zoom masters who give
      away their Saturdays to run awesome classes; thank you to the buddy
      mentors who take time out during the week to catch up with and support
      their buddies; and thank you to all of those who help strengthen the
      community and forge bonds between us!

      To the teachers, Mentors, Volunteers, buddy mentors, tech buddy mentors,
      and everyone involved in the team CYF Scotland, thank you very much for
      everything you do for us. You are the best. The word of thank is little
      for what you are doing for us. You give us your valuble time to make the
      class successful. You do your best to help us understanding the class and
      engaging to the community. You make us feel as part of the community by
      your kindness and well treatment. If I write as many words as possible, it
      is not fulfill what you deserve. We wish to live up your expectations.
      Thank you all.

      teach us life changing skills. Thanks to all the teachers, assistants,
      mentors and volunteers, you are all very much appreciated and I am
      grateful for all time you spend helping and supporting us.
